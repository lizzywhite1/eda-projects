# Ultra Marathon Large Dataset
**Late July**: Ultramarathon Dataset: A dataset with over 7 million entries of UM competitors over the past two centuries. This project involved cleaning, formatting and standardising data as well as engineering new features all using Pandas. It also involved using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualise data.
### What I Learned: 
As this was my first EDA project I learnt a lot. The dataset was very large and it required a lot of cleaning. The dataset required me to be creative in the ways I solved some of the data cleaning issues I was having. I became better at picking up errors in my results and trouble shooting bugs in my code. More specifically some things I learnt were: 
  1. How to find, count and delete missing and duplicate values
  2. How do use string methods to extract necessary data from columns and to clean columns
  3. Using `pd.cut` to create bins/categories for numeric data
  4. How to use string formatting and regular expression and how apply to rows of data
  5. The importance of standardising entries; learnt how to create functions to return a standardised result
  6. `df.groupby` and aggregate functions to quickly obtain and visualise information about subsets of data
### What I could improve upon: 
  1. The effciency of my code: in hindsight, some methods about how I went about cleaning data were not effcient
  2. Ensuring I use categorical data types when possible to save memory
  3. Improving the presentation and motive behind certain visualisations: next time I want to have clear questions in mind and a clear and sensible idea on how is best to visualise certain data
